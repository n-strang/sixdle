# sixdle
This is a simple, yet incomplete spin on the new york times web based game "wordle"
In my version, we use a dictionary file of all words in the english language that use 6 characters. 
The program will stack all of the words into an array, select a word at random, and ask the user to guess the word.

Based on users input, it will tell you if:
1. The letter is in the word
2. The letter is in the correct spot
3. if the letter shows up more than once
4. how many guess you have left
